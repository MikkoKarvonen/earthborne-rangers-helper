Dragonflies, butterflies, and gnats drone lazily through the warm, still air. Cypresses rise up on all sides, their branches intermeshing to form walls of leaves. The 'floor' is a thin pool of still water that stretches from one end of the space to the other. Only a few centimeters deep, it reflects the filtered light back into the branches, giving the Cypress Citadel a green, diffuse glow.",
