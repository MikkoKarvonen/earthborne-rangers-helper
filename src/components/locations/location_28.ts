Only as you get closer can you make out the incongruous details: the regular height and width of the ridge: the occasional vents oozing steam into the still air, and the gaping cavern where the ridge finally terminates in a glen.",

Then the entire 'ridge' shudders and slides forward, and a few more inches of land are shoveled into the maw. The entire ridge is one of the legendary terravores, a kilometers-long biomeld that slowly but inevitably consumes and processes everything in its path.",

The light quickly fades away as you go deeper, and the air becomes thicker and thicker. The ground becomes more jumbled and chaotic as well, and you see rocks and tree trunks giving way to smaller, splintered chunks.",

There seems to be a path along the side of the pool, near a series of protrusions that look uncomfortably like rib bones in the side of the terravore. However, there is also a particularly large log half-submerged in the pool that it looks like you could crawl across.",
