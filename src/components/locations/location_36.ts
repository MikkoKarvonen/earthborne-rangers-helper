There you find a jumbled mix of ruined buildings, huge boulders, and massive chunks of masonry. You recognize the masonry as the same material that made up the great dam that collapsed and left the Fractured Wall to the north. For here is the debris left by the cataclysmic flood caused by that collapse; the ruins of the lost Estian civilization.",
