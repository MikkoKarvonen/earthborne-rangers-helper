This time though, he seems particularly intrigued by what looks like the shell of a giant power coupling protruding from a crack in the wall some two meters above him. He doesn’t seem to notice your approach until a twig cracks underneath your feet. “Oh!” he says, then relaxes. “It’s you. Actually, just the person I wanted to speak to! Well, really I’d love to speak with whoever engineered these pressure sensors, or better yet who removed them ... they appear to have been worn away shortly before the dam broke and the valley flooded.”",

Worn from your journey, you finally rest in the nook of a hollowed tree trunk, which, for once, seems to hug every curve of your aching body. Just as you begin to drift off, you’re startled awake by Silaro’s joyous cry.",
