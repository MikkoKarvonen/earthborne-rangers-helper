Steps wrap around the outside of a dolewood, and you follow them up as they lead to a walkway running along one of the its largest boughs. There you find a hollow dolewood branch fashioned into the shape of a great horn.",

A deep, melodious rumble resonates from its mouth, vibrating your bones and causing the birds to erupt from the forest all around you in a raucous, protesting chorus. You imagine that if you blew harder, the sound would be heard at even the far edges of the forest. It's no wonder that the people of Branch use it as a signaling device.",
