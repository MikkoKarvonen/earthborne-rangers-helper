Once beyond the wall, you can see the squat bulbous shape of the Forge itself, a gray kiln larger than three wagons. As you watch, a trio of sweating artificers haul a series of heavy curved beams out of the Forgeâ€™s mouth; frames for a roof. Another rushes forward to shovel graphite shards into a small hatch on the side. Blue sparks flicker within, and your hair stands on end as the Forge begins to reform the graphite into nano-assembled carbon items.",
