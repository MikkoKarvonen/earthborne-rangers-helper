Fir needles cover its exterior, crisscrossing to create a tapestry reaching up and around the dolewoodâ€™s upper branches.",

On every floor you see villagers drinking, reading, and talking of all the comings and goings of the Valley. The scent of sweet ale washes over you. Near the entrance, a map of the Valley hangs on a wall next to a board covered with handwritten messages and notices.",
