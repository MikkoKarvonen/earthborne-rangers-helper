              "As you move closer, you realize that the “fire” is actually a cunningly crafted sculpture of shards of amber, crimson, and bright ocher kinetic glass. It is lit from beneath, and the sparkling reflections dance across the guests’ faces even as they somehow bathe them in a soothing, comforting heat.",

Calypsa once told you that news spread faster in places like A Hearty Brew than anywhere else in the Valley. You imagine that if you needed to find someone’s location, asking around here would be a good way to start.",
