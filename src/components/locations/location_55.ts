              "Rising up above the tree line, you see the craggy peaks of giant ruins, stretching out along the horizon like a mountain range. They appear to have once been pieces of the large crumbling wall looming in the distance, now long overgrown with trees and bushes. As you make your way deeper into the ruins, you find yourself in a maze of crumbling stone, unable to find a clear path forward. After some time searching, you stumble upon a large fissure scarring one of the ruins ahead. As you illuminate the entrance, what appears to be a long cavern springs up before you.",
              "As you gaze deeper, you see the tunnel splits off in different directions into a labyrinthine array of passages carved through its belly. You catch a glimmer of something along a barren patch of ceiling, and you think you can make out the distinctive, even shine of industrial steel. If these passages were originally man-made, this is the only trace left of its makersâ€™ mark, now buried in the endless, winding silence.",
